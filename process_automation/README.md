## Document management process
This project involved automating a complex integration process (document management process).
Where different client files are created based on **_templates_**, and then **_client folders_** and **_subfolders_** are also generated.
Then those files are **_categorized according to the stages within each folder._** 

This automation was performed with Google Apps Script. 

A Google Drive folder was created containing the source data spreadsheet and the google doc templates.
Source Data spreadsheet will include the data to auto-fill the google doc templates.
Google doc templates are the same word documents, will use them to merge data pulled from the Source Data into the copies that you make.
